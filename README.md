## PFS.R
This is a Rcode for calculating PFS.
### Method
Assuming a normal distribution, a set of integer samples of a predetermined size is generated at random within the given scale using the provided mean and standard deviation (SD). Subsequently, the samples are standardized to a range between 0 and 1, resulting in updated mean and SD values. This process is repeated 10,000 times, and the average is taken as the final estimate.
